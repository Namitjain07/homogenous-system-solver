This is a Python script that performs matrix operations using the SymPy and NumPy libraries.

## Requirements

    1. Python 3.x
    2. SymPy
    3. NumPy

## Installation

    1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
    2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
```python
    pip install sympy numpy
```
## Usage
    1. Create a file named matrix.txt and populate it with the matrix values. Each row should be on a new line, and elements within a row should be separated by spaces.
    2. Modify the rows and cols variables in the script to specify the number of rows and columns in your matrix, respectively.
    3. Run the script using the following command:

    ```python
    python Simulator.py
    ```
## Output
    The script performs the following operations on the input matrix:

    1. Prints the original matrix.
    2. Computes the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the matrix and prints it.
    3. Computes the null space of the matrix and prints it.
    4. Generates a list of variables representing the columns not present in the RREF.
    5. Prints the linear combinations of the null space vectors using the variables from step 4.

## Example

Suppose the input matrix is as follows:
    `1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9`
Running the script will produce the following output:
```python
MARTRIX= [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
RREF Matrix: [[1, 0, -1], [0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0]]
Null Space Vectors: [[1, -2, 1]]
Linear Combination: x3 * [1, -2, 1] + []

```
In this example, the RREF of the matrix is [[1, 0, -1], [0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0]], and the null space contains one vector [1, -2, 1]. The linear combination shows that the solution involves multiplying x3 with the null space vector.
